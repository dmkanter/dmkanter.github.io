I speak Chinese. My Chinese name is Kang Tai. I work for Blackberry. I like Technology. I am a geek. This is the base Jekyll theme on github. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). I think I'll do this in the near future. Right now I'm just happy this works. One thing I'd also like to do is host this on my github site. [dmkanter.github.io](http://dmkanter.github.io)
