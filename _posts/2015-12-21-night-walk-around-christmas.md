Recently, I&#8217;ve been trying to get a bit more exercise so I&#8217;m trying to get 10,000 steps per day. Yesterday my walk was around the neighborhood during the day. I must say that the houses are much prettier in the evening. Here are some photos I took this evening on my walk tonight. (And by the way I hit 10,000 steps according to my Fitbit and Apple Watch!)
