some inspirational quotes someone posted on facebook. I used scanbot to perform OCR. 

> Live beneath your means. Return everything 
> you borrow. Stop blaming other people
Admit it when you make a mistake. Give
clothes not wom to chanity. Do something
nice and try not to get caught. Listen more;
talk less. Every day take a 30-minute walk. Strive for excellence, not perfection. Be on
time. Don't make excuses. Don't argue. Get good manners. Be humble. Realize and
accept that life isn’t fair. Know when to keep
> your mouth shut. Go an entire day without:
criticizing anyone, Learn from the past 
for the future. Live in the present. Don't
sweat the small stuff. It’s all small stuff.
