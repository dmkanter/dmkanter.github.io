## Links to check out. Found on 12&#8211;22&#8211;14

[http://bettermess.com/plain-text-primer-nvalt&#8211;101/](http://bettermess.com/plain-text-primer-nvalt-101/ "notational velocity") link I found surfing tonight.

The ipad and the iphone have got to be the greatest invention ever. my wife is sleeping next to me as i write this in bed. it will require some cleanup later. things to investigate

  * why doesnt byword auto capetilize?
  * should i change to move all my text files to dropbox?
  * should i upgrade to a 1TB dropbox account?
  * what other tricks on byword for ipad exist that i dont know about?
  * should i try using notationAl velocity?

## Ah ha!

well i found a row of keys that show up on top of the ipad keyboard now that allow me to add links. here&#8217;s a test of code

    print "hi"
    

> this is a block quote. isnt this amazing? 

Ok. Finally I noticed that there was a preference in byword for auto capitalization and spell check. Now, finally I can type much faster because I have come to rely on the messy typing that happens when my keys aren&#8217;t perfectly on the keyboard. Whenever I try to type without spellcheck or autocapitalization it&#8217;s a train wreck.
