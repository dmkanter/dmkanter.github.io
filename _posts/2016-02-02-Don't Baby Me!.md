Still feeling rather sick today but went to Dr. It was tough to believe that all this is allergies and asthma. My eyes were red and had the color of allergies too whatever that means. Every Dr was also sick I had to wait an extra day and then drive to the Chula Vista office which is about 20 miles away. I got some prescriptions for nasal and whatnot. I can already breathe through my nose much better.  Who's that kid above? Why it's me! My mom sent it to me.
