# Blogging from the iPad

Some apps mentioned in this post that are for text nerds:

  * Drafts
  * Byword
  * iA Writer
  * Editorial
  * Workflow

I recently bought [Fredrico Viticci&#8217;s](https://twitter.com/viticci) [Writing on the iPad: Text Automation with Editorial](http://www.macstories.net/news/introducing-writing-on-the-ipad-text-automation-with-editorial/ "Introducing “Writing On The iPad: Text Automation with Editorial” – MacStories") and have been using it to learn about text automation on the iPad. My iPad 2 is very old and slow, however this app still works just fine, and when I use markdown and my iPad 2 keyboard, it feels very fast. Perhaps I&#8217;ve found a nice use for my iPad 2 finally. Anyhow, back to the book, it&#8217;s really a lot of fun because I&#8217;m learning both iOS workflow automation and Python all at the same time. There&#8217;s no telling what can be done.

I&#8217;ve also been playing with [Workflow](https://workflow.is/ "Workflow | Powerful automation made simple."), the new iOS automation app that hooks up various apps together.
