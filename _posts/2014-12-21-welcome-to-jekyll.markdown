Here's my first Jekyll post. it's pretty nerdy and pretty fun. I'm just running this on an S3 bucket I dump a lot of media to for fun and syncing from my MacBook Air using python and a s3cmd sync. Learned how to do this form this [article](http://statiq.io/blog/2013/12/11/how-to-install-jekyll-and-run/)

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
