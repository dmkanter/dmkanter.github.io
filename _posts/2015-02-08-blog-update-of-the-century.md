It’s been a while since I’ve made any updates. <img src="http://i2.wp.com/media.davidkanter.com/Photo-2015-02-08-18-48.jpg?w=604" alt="Rainbow" data-recalc-dims="1" />Not much is new and I wish I had more time to blog. I have all these ideas for a blog, but lately it’s been the same old set of excuses… I’m too busy. What’s new with me? I re-read GTD and started getting into David Allen Again. I bought Things for iOS and for mac, and am enjoying the product so far, and with he GTD process, I feel like I’m getting more done. Even recently, I’ve been getting 10,000+ steps in too and that isn’t bad at all! What’s up with the picture? It’s an image that my son’s mom sent me to show to his little brother. He said there was a rainbow in it, but I didn’t see it. Anyhow, I hope to blog more in the future, thanks for coming! Now I do, my son pointed it out to me <img src="http://i1.wp.com/kangtai.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" />
