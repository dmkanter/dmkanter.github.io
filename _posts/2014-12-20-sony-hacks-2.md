I&#8217;ve been listening to a lot of press about the Sony hacks and I have a couple opinions on the whole thing. I don&#8217;t think that the public should be sifting through the repository of private information that is available, nor do I think they should be reporting off it either. Also, I don&#8217;t blame Sony for not distributing the movie. Yes, sure you can say we&#8217;re all cowards but it&#8217;s better we&#8217;re protected than killed at a movie. Yes, you can now say that everytime that there is cyberterror we will do whatever the hackers ask for, however this to me seems different, and it&#8217;s a new world of cyber-warfare that we live in today.

What do yo think?
